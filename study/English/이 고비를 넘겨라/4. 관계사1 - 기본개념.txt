# 정리
1. 한 문장 안에는 언제나 핵심 동사가 하나다.
2. 그러나 등위 접속사나 상관 접속사로 동사들이 연결된 문장은 핵심 동사가 두개 이상일 수 있다.
3. 등위 접속사나 상관 접속사가 아닌 종속 접속사로 연결될 때에는 주절의 동사가 문장의 핵심 동사이다.
   * 종속절의 동사는 문장의 핵심 동사가 아니므로 주의 한다.
4. 종속절의 종류에는 명사절, 형용사절(=관계사절), 부사절이 있다.

01. 관계사란?
    두 문장(절)을 연결하고 싶은데 두 문장속에 공통 분모(선행사)가 들어가 있는 경우에 사용한다.
     
    I know Elizabeth. Mark wants to have pizza for lunch.
    -> I know Elizabeth and Mark wants to have pizza for lunch ( 등위 접속사 and )
    I know Elizabeth. Elizabeth wants to have pizza for lunch.
    -> I know Elizabeth and Elizabeth wants to have pizza for lunch.
    * Elizabeth와 같은 공통 분모를 '선행사'라고 한다.
    -> I know Elizabeth who wants to have pizza for lunch.

02. 관계사의 종류
1) 관계 대명사 = 관계사(접속사) + 명사
    접속사와 대명사, 두가지 역할을 한단어가 하는것.

    Language is a tool. The tool links us to people around the world.
    -> Language is a tool and the tool links us to people around the world.
    -> Language is a tool which links us to people around the world.
    * which는 and + tool 역할을 하고 있다.

    I remember the people. We met people in Paris.
    -> I remember the people and We met people in Paris.
    -> I remember the people who(m) whe met in Paris.
    * who(m)은 and + the people

    위의 두 문장의 차이점은 
    1. 대명사의 역할 (주어위치, 목적어위치)
    2. 관계 대명사의 쓰임 ( 선행사가 사람인지, 사물인지)

    선행사      사람        사람/사물       사물/동물

* 관계 대명사절을 포함한 문장을 해석하는 법
1. 관계 대명사절이 선행사인 명사를 꾸며 주는 의미가 되도록 해석하고, 
2. 머리가 커진 명사를 전체 문장에 맞춰(명사가 주어가되면 주어!, 목적어면 목적어!) 해석해주면 된다.

        district containing the city of Washington.

2) 관계 부사 = 관계사(접속사)+부사
    관계 부사는 접속사와 부사, 두가지 역할을 하는 한개의 단어
    * 전치사 + 관계 대명사 = 관계 부사

    * 선행사가 시간(the time = when), 장소(the place = where),
